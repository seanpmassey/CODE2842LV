## Go Start Your Horizon Automation Journey
I'm presenting CODE2842LV - Go Start Your Horizon Automation Journey at VMware Explore 2023 in Las Vegas.  The session is in the VMware Code Theater on Tuesday, August 22nd at 9:00 AM Pacific Time, and it's a technical L100 session.

This session will cover a couple of basic Horizon API tasks, and I will be showcasing them using a small tool I wrote using the Go Programming language.  This code is a little ugly. There are probably better, cleaner, more efficient ways to do this, but I am not a programmer by trade, and some of this was figured out using Google/StackOverflow/etc.

A couple of things I'm doing with this tool are:
* Authenticating and Logging Out of the Horizon REST API
* Retrieving data using some of the Horizon REST API Get calls (with and without filters)
* Using a POST call to log users out of a session (if I can get it to work before Tuesday)
